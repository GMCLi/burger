# burger

**Before use, install packages *npm install***

This project was to create an app that allows the user to...
1. See the list of available burgers
2. Add to that list
3. Devour any of the available burgers
4. See the list of burgers that have been devoured

When the app runs, there will be a list of available burgers with buttons that allows the user to devour each of them. Once devoured, the burger will be removed from that list and subsequently added to the list of devoured burgers.
